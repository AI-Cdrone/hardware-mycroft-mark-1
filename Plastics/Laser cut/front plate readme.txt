How to make a Mycroft Mark 1 front plate

1. Laser cut the outline all the way through the .125" acrylic (Plexiglass 2074)
2. Laser cut the mic holes all the way through the acrylic, remove the front plate, but save the waste.
4. Laser cut the screen mask to go through just the paper, peel the paper off but leave the rectangle for masking the screen area. Leave the paper on the opposite side.
5. Paint the masked side with black spray paint.
6. Laser Raster the eyes on the painted sided by placing the front plate back into the acrylic waste from the first cut.
